# 🌻 FarmHeroes

My defense project for ASP.NET Core course at SoftUni (January 2020).

*FarmHeroes is a **browser game** in which two factions (🐏 **rams** and 🐖 **boars**) **fight** each other, and you, as a player, choose which of the two to **join**. The goal is to **develop your character** by **working** and **robbing opponents**, who may be other **players** or **monsters**. There are several locations where you can **work**, **fight** or **get equipment**. Become the **strongest** ungulate on the farm and show your **might**!*
